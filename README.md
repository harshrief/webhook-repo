# GitHub Webhook Listener 🚀

A Flask app that listens to GitHub Webhooks for push and pull request events and stores them in MongoDB Atlas.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 3.10
- Flask
- MongoDB Atlas
- GitHub Webhooks
- Ngrok

## 📦 How It Works
1. GitHub Webhook sends events to `/webhook`
2. Events are stored in MongoDB
3. `/events` route displays JSON data
4. Frontend fetches and shows events live

## 📌 Important Notes
✅ This project demonstrates a Flask-based webhook listener for GitHub events.

✅ It uses MongoDB Atlas to store push and pull request data in real time.

✅ Ngrok is used to expose the local Flask server to the internet for GitHub webhook testing.

✅ GitHub sends events to the /webhook route, which are processed and stored with timestamps.

✅ Frontend (index.html + script.js) fetches events via /events and displays them live.

✅ Tested with Python 3.10, Flask, and PyMongo.

✅ MongoDB URI and credentials are securely managed using a .env file.
